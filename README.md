# Progress Bar Application

This is a simple application that displays three progress bars and allows you to manipulate their progress using buttons.

## How to Use

1. Select the progress bar you want to manipulate using the select box.
2. Click on the `-25`, `-10`, `+10`, or `+25` button to decrease or increase the progress of the selected bar by the corresponding amount.
3. The progress bar will not go below 0. If you try to decrease it below 0, it will remain at 0.
4. The progress bar will change color to red if it goes over 100.
